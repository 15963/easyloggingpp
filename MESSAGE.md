# The Message
Easylogging++ and other products by Muflihun Labs are primarily focused on *dawah*. We have a message to give to everyone out there.

The message is simple and easy to understand:

Allah ﷻ is The Creator, The Sustainer, The Controller of everything. Therefore, He ﷻ is the only one to be worshipped. All the prophets, including Prophet Abraham, Prophet Joseph, Prophet Jacob, Prophet Noah, Prophet Lot, Prophet Moses, Propeht Jesus and Prophet Muhammad, and all other, came with single message.

 > Worship Allah and avoid Taghut. [Qur'aan, Surah An-Nahl 16:36]

We are your fellow human beings who worship no one but Him ﷻ and the only way to salvation is to accept the Only religion accepted by Allah ﷻ. Lest you be resurrected on the Day of Judgement to be thrown in to the Hellfire.

All we say, do not listen to what media feeds you, and do not believe in what media has fed you. Do your own research, if you are seeker of the truth and work towards it with true sincerity, then Allah ﷻ will guide you and show you the truth, that Islaam is the religion accepted by Allah. 

 > Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account. [Qur'aan, Surah Aali Imraan, 3:19]

> And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers. [Qur'aan, Surah Aali Imraan, 3:85]

Islaam is not what you think of it. To learn more see https://muflihun.com/articles/islam

May Allah ﷻ guide you and keep us on the straight path
